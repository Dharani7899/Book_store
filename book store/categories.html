            <dd><p>Children to the Slaughter is a typical small-town horror novella where children are kidnapped by some supernatural beast that runs amuck at night. The story has promise, but I just feel it played its cards way too close for comfort. The prose is so very clerical and plain to the point that it became aggravating.</p></dd>
